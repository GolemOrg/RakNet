# A RakNet library built in the Kotlin Programming Language

## Introduction
The first question to ask about this library should be: "why?"

The short answer is that it is a personal learning project. I wanted to learn Kotlin and I wanted to use it to build 
a library for something that has always challenged me to wrap my head around: RakNet.

While not the most complex protocol, RakNet is a protocol used by many games, but my use case is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

## Protocol
Personal documentation for the protocol can be found [here](https://github.com/GolemOrg/raknet-kt/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md).
If there are any inaccuracies found, please feel free to [create](https://github.com/GolemOrg/raknet-kt/issues/new) an issue!
